React Practice Project 
Students should build a simple online store application, it should allow users to navigate products organized by categories, add items to the shopping cart and process item’s payment. 
  
* feat1 – Home page should display all available categories and allow navigation to individual categories. 
* feat2 – Category page should display all items for a given category, it should allow user to add items to the shopping cart. 
* feat3 – Directory page should display top 5 items for each category, it should allow user to add items to the shopping cart. 
* feat4 – Shopping cart preview should allow users, at any moment, a quick visualization of items added to the cart. 
* feat5 – In order to check out, users must be logged in, application should allow users to register and log in once they’re registered. Users should remain logged in even if they close the application until JWT expires. 
* feat6 – Checkout page should allow users to review items in the cart, add or remove items, increase/decrease item’s quantity, display purchase total and recalculate it when items are removed or quantities are edited. 
* feat7 – Process payment should allow users to input payment information (card number, card holder, expiration and CVV), simulate payment processing and display purchase confirmation message. 
  
Restrictions 
Students must use knowledge acquired in every session to build the application. 
If specific libraries are used during the session, they must be used to build the application. 
Students will organize in teams up to 3 members to build the application. 
  
Recommendations 
Feel free to use the same or similar design/layout of the application reviewed in session. 
Ask your mentors/teachers to clarify any question or implement best practices in your application. 
Setup a github repository and use Gitflow workflow. 
Even when you’re working in teams, share ideas, questions and thoughts with the entire group.
